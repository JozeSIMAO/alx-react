# 0x05. React state

## React State

React state is a built-in feature that allows components to manage and store data that can change over time. It is used to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

## React Hooks

React hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. They provide a way to write reusable and stateful logic without using class components.

## Lifecycles

React components have a lifecycle that consists of different phases, such as mounting, updating, and unmounting. Lifecycles provide methods that allow you to perform actions at specific points in a component's lifecycle, such as initializing state, fetching data, or cleaning up resources.

## setState

setState is a method provided by React that allows you to update the state of a component. It takes an object as an argument and merges it with the current state. React then re-renders the component with the updated state.

## State Callbacks

When using setState, you can provide a callback function as the second argument. This callback function will be executed after the state has been updated and the component has been re-rendered. It can be useful for performing actions that depend on the updated state.
